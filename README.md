Project: Security Log View System

Tech Stack: PHP (Laravel), MySQL, Chart.js, CSV files, Email Notifications

Overview:
The Security Log View System is a comprehensive application designed to monitor, process, and analyze security-related logs from various systems. It provides organizations with real-time insights into user activity, system events, and potential threats. By automating the ingestion of system log files, processing their data, and generating analytics, the system ensures proactive monitoring and quick response to security incidents.

Project Workflow and Features

Log Collection and CSV Integration

System logs are generated by different components such as Antivirus software, Firewalls, and Servers.

These logs are exported or received in CSV format, which serves as the primary data source.

The system monitors designated folders for new CSV files and reads them automatically.

Data Processing and Storage

Each CSV file is parsed using Laravelâ€™s PHP backend.

Data is cleaned, structured, and stored in a MySQL database.

Each log entry includes additional metadata, such as log_type derived from the filename.

The system dynamically handles different CSV structures, ensuring flexibility across log types.

CSV files are not deleted after processing, allowing historical review and repeated data analysis.

Analytics and Dashboard Visualization

The system provides a rich dashboard for data visualization using Chart.js.

Key analytics include:

Top 5 users with failed login attempts

Users logging in outside office hours (after 6 PM)

Top devices or PCs with antivirus alerts

Top IP addresses generating the most traffic

Data can be viewed interactively, with drill-down capabilities for detailed insights.

Threat Detection and Alerting

The system monitors logs for potential threats or suspicious activity.

When a threat is detected (e.g., repeated failed login attempts, malware alerts), the system automatically sends email notifications to the designated users or administrators.

This feature ensures proactive response to security issues before they escalate.

Additional Capabilities

Supports multiple log types (Antivirus, Firewall, System logs) with dynamic table creation.

Historical log analysis for auditing and compliance purposes.

User-friendly interface for monitoring and managing logs.

Benefits

Automated monitoring: Reduces manual effort in log review and processing.

Real-time analytics: Offers actionable insights immediately upon log processing.

Proactive threat response: Alerts users of potential threats instantly via email.

Scalability and flexibility: Handles multiple log formats dynamically.

Audit and compliance support: Maintains historical logs for review.
